Build the jar with:
  mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies
put in /usr/share/openfire/lib/
also put there a link to the wave-server.conf configuration so it can read the server public IP/port.

Removing the "provided" tag in openfire dependency and generanting again the jar, we can test something like:
```
java -jar target/kune-openfireauth-1.0.2-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 127.0.0.1:8888 1 admin easyeasy
```
with a kune test server running in that port.
